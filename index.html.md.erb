## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
- The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed on your machine.
- Some familiarity with [BOSH](https://bosh.io/).
- The [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html) installed on your machine.

Ops Manager automates the BOSH deployment of software products, but introduces additional complexity as well. As a tile author, you should first confirm that your product successfully deploys with BOSH before attempting to deploy it with Ops Manager.

1. [Deploying A PCF Product Using BOSH](./deploying-with-bosh.html) describes the procedure for deploying a release of your software product with BOSH. Confirm that this is successful before proceeding to deploy with Ops Manager.

1. [Deploying Your Product as a Tile in Ops Manager](./deploying-with-ops-man-tile.html) describes the procedure for creating a tile for your product and deploying to Ops Manager.

[Product Template Reference](./product-template-reference.html) provides explanations for the BOSH manifest key-value pairs that are required for an Ops Manager product template.
